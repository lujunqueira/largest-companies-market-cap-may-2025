# Largest Companies by Market Cap (2025) – Tableau Redesign

This project is a data-driven redesign of Visual Capitalist’s infographic showing the world’s 50 most valuable companies as of May 2025.

### What’s Different
- Grouped by **industry sector**, not brand color
- Uses a **treemap layout** to reflect company market cap
- Includes **sector totals** to highlight macroeconomic patterns
- Built in **Tableau**, allowing sorting, filtering, and exploration

### Key Insights
- Over **1/3** of top companies are tech-based
- **Finance** and **healthcare** continue to anchor global value

### Files
- `MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES.twbx` – Tableau packaged workbook
- `Companies ranked by Market Cap.csv` – Cleaned dataset (sourced from [CompaniesMarketCap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/))
